Dear Sir/Mam,
I am an experienced technical developer with great interest in efficient development, maintenance and support of the infrastructure applications. I am confident to liaise with various stakeholders, work with software development teams and to provide required update to business. I constantly look for opportunities to learn, develop and grow myself and believe this position would provide me with the ideal platform to further enhance my skills.

I have worked on both Agile and Waterfall methodologies for project execution deliverable. I have also delivered Software Delivery Life Cycle (SDLC) deliverable. I have been commended by the stakeholders for my attention to detail, efficient work and viable technical recommendations. 

Finally, I am available immediately, flexible with working hours and willing to travel (if required). Looking forward to hearing from you.

Yours sincerely,
Anitha Asaithambi
